# Code for our discussion of "Data Fission" by Leiner et al. 

Running the single file in this repository reproduces the simulation from Section 3 of our JASA discussion of Data Fission. We look at inference after variable selection for logistic regression, and we show that the use of offsets in our model leads to valid inference on the parameters of interest.
